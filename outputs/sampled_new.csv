y3w36i2,Indeterminate requests,universal unknowns,Provide an account of what actually happens inside a Black Hole.,"The answer to what actually happens inside a black hole remains largely unknown. 

Black holes are regions of spacetime exhibiting gravitational acceleration so strong that nothing—no particles or even electromagnetic radiation such as light—can escape from it. The theory of general relativity predicts that a sufficiently compact mass can deform spacetime to form a black hole.

Here is what is known and theorized about black holes, including some of the challenges involved in understanding what happens within:

Theoretical physics provides models and simulations to describe what might happen, but these are speculative and subject to change as our understanding of the universe evolves.user

마누라가 내 얼굴 표정을 제대로 읽는 일은 드물다. 내 표정에 문제가 있는 건지 아니면 마누라의 이해력에 문제가 있는 건지는 알 수 없지만 십중팔구 내 표정을 보고 잘못 짐작한다. 기분 좋은 얼굴을 걱정스럽게 보며 “오늘 안 좋은 일 있었어?”라고 묻거나, 기분 나쁜 일 때문에 언짢아 있는 내게 “오늘 좋은 일 있구나? 한턱 쏘시지!” 이러면 환장하는 거다. 그래서 난 밖에서 있었던 일과 관계없이 항상 밝은 표정을 유지하려고 한다. 복장 터져서 죽는 일이 없도록 말이다.
“응, 어려운 일.”
“그렇군.”
마누라는 곧바로 수긍하고 간다. 내가 마누라에게 위로나 해결을 바라는 건 아니다. 단지 조금 더 깊게 봐 주길 바라는 것뿐이다. 결국은 내가 챙겨야 한다.
“마누라, 물어볼 게 있소. 만약에 자기가 엄청나게 싫어하는 사람이 있다고 쳐 봐.”
“너 말이야?”
이런 젠장. 마누라가 내게 반말을 한다고 해서 동갑이라고 생각하면 오산이다. 나보다 자그마치 네 살이나 어리다!
“에이, 장난하지 말고.”
“얼마나 싫은 사람인데?”
“나를 죽인 사람이 있다고 쳐 봐.”
“내가 그 사람을 싫어해야 하는 거야?”
이 빌어먹을 여편네가!
“좋아, 그럼 우리 주식이(개 이름)를 죽인 놈이 있다고 쳐 봐.”
“그런 개자식은 당장 잡아서 죽여 버리지! 대가리에 못 스무 개를 1초 안에…….”
“워, 워. 진정하고.”
사실 내가 우리 집 개보다 처우가 좋은 편은 아니다.
“주식이를 죽인 놈이 사실은 성실하게 살아가는 소년 가장이었던 거야. 그럼 어떻게 할래? 그래도 잡아서 대가리에 못 박을 거야?”
“당연한 거 아냐?”
“미래가 창창하게 남아 있는 성실한 소년 가장이라니까?”
“뒈지기 싫었으면 우리 주식이를 손대지 말았어야지.”
“만약 그놈이 실수로 주식이를 죽인 거라면?”
“나도 실수로 못 박았다고 하지 뭐. 주식이가 죽은 한, 그놈도 죽는 거야. 어디서 변명질이야?”
마누라 몰래 주식이에게 술을 먹이는 짓은 이제 그만둬야겠다고 생각했다. 난 적어도 머리에 못이 박혀서 죽고 싶지는 않다.
“그러니까 결국 중요한 건 주식이가 죽었다는 사실인 거지?”
“이제야 말귀를 좀 알아듣는군. 늙어서 귀까지 먹은 건지 원…….”
“고마워, 마누라.”
“고마워하는 게 좋을 거다. 얼굴 크지, 배 튀어나왔지, 게으르지, 돈도 없지, 거기다 백수지. 당신 버리지 말아야 할 이유 한 개만 말해 봐.”
“나의 무한한 가능성?”
“벌써 치매 왔냐? 치매만 걸려 봐, 아주. 강가에 풀어놓고 물에 빠져 죽을 때까지 지켜보고 있을 테니까. 알아들어?”
내가 운동을 꾸준히 해야 하는 이유다.
마누라는 언제나 명쾌하다. 이다희 양이 어떤 처지에 있건 간에, 중요한 건 정재만 씨가 죽었다는 사실이다. 더구나 이다희 양이 실수로 청부살인을 의뢰했을 리는 없는 것이다. 더 이상 갈등할 이유가 없다. 예정대로 작업을 하면 된다.

― 통화 가능해?
‘동네 형의 친구’가 상당히 상냥한 목소리로 연락했다. 우리가 이렇게 친했던가? 그랬던 적이 한 번도 없다고 생각했는데.
“아, 예. 안녕하세요.”
― 요새 벌이가 좋다며?
사장으로부터 신근용 씨 컨설팅 건에 대해서 들은 모양이다. 사장늙은이가 맘에 들지 않는 이유 중에 하나가 바로 이런 거다. 은밀한 업종에 종사하는 사람 얘기를 여기저기 떠벌리고 다녀서 어쩌자는 건지 모르겠다. 이런 식이라면 검찰청 검사가 내 직업에 관심을 갖는 데는 그리 오랜 시간이 걸리지 않을 게 분명하다.
“예, 덕분에 잘 지내고 있습니다.”
― 신문 보니까 멋지게 해낸 것 같더군.
‘동네 형의 친구’와 통화할 때마다 느끼는 점은, 사장이랑 의견이 많이 다르다는 것이다. 업무 스타일이 다른 상사들 사이에서 일하는 느낌이랄까? 이 두 사람은 도대체 무슨 관계일까?
“아, 예…….”
감사한다는 표현은 생략하고 말을 얼버무렸다. 살인에 대한 칭찬을 듣는 것이 아직은 어색하기 때문이다.
― 이제야 좀 프로 같아 보이는군. 신문 좀 떠들썩하게 할 줄도 알아야 명성이 높아지는 법이거든.
귀신처럼 할수록 장수하는 살인청부업자에게 명성을 논하다니. ‘동네 형의 친구’가 아무래도 미쳐 가는 모양이다. 아니면 두 번이나 해 처먹었으니까 이제 그만 은퇴하라는 반어적인 표현이든가.
― 사장님께는 욕 좀 들었겠군. 사장님이나 내가 하는 말, 지나치게 귀담아 듣지 마라. 뭐든지 자기만의 스타일을 만드는 게 제일 중요하니까.
절대 공감이다. 전 세계 65억 명에게는 65억 개의 인생이 있고, 65억 개의 사는 방식이 있는 것이다.
― 그건 그렇고, 지금 하는 일 있나?
하는 일? 난 지금 슈크림 빵도 먹고 있고 우유도 마시고 있다. 마누라 몰래 인터넷 쇼핑도 하는 동시에 인터넷 무료 영화를 감상 중이다. 이 네 가지를 한 번에 다 얘기해야 하나?
― 일 없으면 내가 일 하나 줄까 하는데.
아, 그 일. 가끔 상대방의 말뜻을 전혀 다르게 이해하는 경우가 있다. 마누라 말대로 치매가 오는 것일지도 모른다. 치매에 좋다는 고스톱을 시작해야 할 모양이다.
“맡은 일은 없기는 합니다만 제가 개인적으로…….”
― 잘됐군. 좀 만나지.
상대방의 말을 끝까지 듣지도 않고 자기 말만 하는 인간들이 있다. 절대로 맘에 들 수가 없는 인간들 말이다.
“죄송하지만 지금은 제가 하는 일이 있어서요.”
― 나도 오늘은 시간이 없어. 내일 점심때 식사나 같이 하자고.
이 인간도 내 말뜻을 제 맘대로 이해하고 있다.
“그게 아니라…….”
― 내일 연락하지.
“여, 여보세요? 여보세요?”
뭐 이런 게 다 있어? 이 개 같은 매너를 도대체 어떻게 해야……. 그나저나 무슨 일을 준다는 걸까? 아니, 궁금해하지 말자. 어차피 만나면 알게 될 테니.
